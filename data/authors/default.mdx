I am a Full Stack Developer with over a decade of experience. In 2013, I started as a self-taught web developer doing freelance work for non-profit organizations and then worked my way up to developer for large corporations such as Cracker Barrel and United Methodist Communications.

Today, I constantly look for ways to bring the latest technology into business solutions that make an impact from C#/.NET and JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue for the frontend, Python and Djangop for the backend, and API Development to manage data calls for internal web applications and external API's for third-party applications that businesses may use.

I would love the opportunity to connect and work with you on a project! Feel free to reach me anytime via email or social media.
